<h4>Testing Criteria.</h4>
<p>Some rules to make it to the Leader Board:<br><ul>
<li>Your program must run.</li>
<li>Your program must run through Valgind with no errors or memory leaks.  Very few submissions have had any trouble meeting this requirement.</li>
</ul>
The test is run on all 33 .txt files in ~cs50/pset6/texts.<br><br>

The test is run ten times, the best of the ten is used on the board.<br><br>

The test is run on a HP ProBook 4440s with a Intel Celeron CPU B840 @ 1.90GHZ using Linux Mint 16 64bit as the OS w 4.00GB of ram.<br><br>

The 32 bit libs are installed in Linux so the tests can be run outside the "CS50 Appliance".  All tests are run with the same configuration.<br><br>
