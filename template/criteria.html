  <h4>Testing Criteria.</h4>
  Some rules to make it to the Leader Board:<br />
	<ul>
    <li>Your program must run.</li>
    <li>Your program must run through Valgrind with no errors or memory leaks.&nbsp;
		    Very few submissions have had any trouble meeting this requirement.</li>
  </ul>
  The test is run on all 33 .txt files in ~cs50/pset6/texts.<br />
  <br />
  The test is run a minimum of ten times, the fastest total time is used on the board.<br />
  <br />
  The test is run on a HP ProBook 4440s with a Intel Celeron CPU B840 @ 1.90GHZ
	using Linux Mint 16 64bit as the OS with 4GB of ram.&nbsp; The 32 bit libs are
  installed in Linux OS so the tests can be run outside the "CS50 Appliance".&nbsp; All tests
  are run with the same configuration.<br />
